## Drug Discovery

### Target Identification(타겟 선정)

약물로 표적화할 분자 선택

**“Druggable”(Druggability)** target : 약물 분자와 잠재적으로 상호작용할 수 있거나 약물 분자에 영향받을 수 있는 타겟

**Strategies**

- Omics : transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.
- Phenotype analysis
- Functional screening
- Genetic association
- Literature
- **Predictions** ← cheminformatics & AI

### Target Validation (타겟 검증)

test target & confirm its role in the disease (according to the proposed mode of action)

clinical efficacy(capacity to produce an effect)의 가능성과 직접적으로 연결됨.

- Genetic knockdown, knockout, in vitro cell-based mechanistic studies
- Animal models : translation of in vivo validation into humans
- **Early Safety Tests** (ADME/Tox properties)
    
    promising compounds 초기 test 수행
    
    ADME/Tox properties : Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion(배설) and Toxicological properties
    
    ⇒ performed in ‘**living cells**’, animals, ‘**computational models**’

 **선도 물질 (Lead Compound)**

Molecule that *may act on their targe*t to *alter* the disease course(병세)

Approaches

- Nature(천연물)
- De novo design(신약설계 - 처음부터)
- **High-throughput screening(HTS) : compound library → 물질 screen**

### Target to Hit

선도 물질(Lead Compound)를 찾자!

- 전통적인 방법 : High througput screening(HTS)
- Computational design
    - **Ligand-based : QSAR**
        
        Ligand activity 정보만.
        
    - **Target-based : docking**
        
        Target sequence/structure만.
        

### Hit to Lead (Lead generation)

small molecule hits (from a HTS) are evaluated

undergo limited optimization to identify promising lead compounds

### Lead Optimization

Alter the **structure** of lead candidates / compounds → improve properties. more desirable properties. (increased specificity & 부작용 감소)

need to consider : **formulation / delivery mechanism / large-scale manufacturing**

## Preclinical Testing

Lab and animal testing

in **vitro** & in **vivo** tests

'in **vitro**' : **시험관내에서** 실험할 때 쓰는 표현으로 'vitro'는 시험관이라는 뜻의 라틴어

'in **vivo**' : **vivo**는 '살아있는(to live, be alive)'의 뜻을 가진 라틴어로 **생체내에서** 실험할 때, 즉 세포나 동물실험 등에 사용되는 표현

대략 5000~10000 compounds → [clinical trial] 단계에서 다룰 “candidate drugs”

## Clinical Trial

Phase 1 Clinical Trial

- initial human testing in a small group of healthy volunteers(20-100)
- discover if the drug is safe in humans
- **Eroom’s Law** - Diagnosing the **decline** in pharmaceutical R&D efficiency

Phase 2 Clinical Trial

- test in a small group of patients(100-500)

Phase 3 Clinical Trial

- test in a larger group of patients(1000-5000)

- Lack of efficacy 등의 **문제 원인**
    
    Primary causes
    
    - The ‘better than the Beatles’ problem
    - The ‘cautious regulator’ problem
    - The ‘throw money at it’ tendency
    - The ‘basic research–brute force’ bias
    
    Secondary causes 
    
    - The narrow clinical search problem
    - The clinical trial problem
    - The long cycle time problem

### Investigational New Drug (IND) Application and Safety

File IND with the FDA before clinical testing can begin

Ensure safety for clinical trial volunteers through an Institutional Review Board
