# FP2VEC

FP2VEC: a new molecular featurizer for learning molecular properties
https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz307

This repositary provides example codes for FP2VEC and CNN based QSAR model.
* Tox21: the example of classification task on Tox21 dataset. 
* ESOL: the example of regression task on ESOL dataset.

The FP2VEC and the QSAR model is implemented by Tensorflow and DeepChem.
